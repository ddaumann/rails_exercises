# Rails Exercises

Exercises in rails, sorted by difficulty and topic.

While this is mostly for myself to practise and remember,  
I have tried to document it properly, so that others can pick up  
the essentials easily enough.

## Documentation... where?

A good place to look for the documentation is generally the README  
in the rails projects and the level directories.  
I am also commiting changes with meaningful messages, so the log wil give you a very good idea of the workflow.

# Using haml with rails

Using haml instead of erb is very simple:

Gemfile:

`gem "haml"`

Now haml will render all view templates that end with .haml.  
You can start by simply renaming all your erbs to hamls, haml acts as drop in for erb.

When you are ready you can start to convert your erb files or completely rewrite them.
